# SevenTV-lib
SevenTV-lib implements 7TV V3 API into easy to use C# library. I'll try to update this library as frequently as possible with new implementations from 7TV side.

# Dependencies
SevenTV-lib is using [Newtonsoft.JSON](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) to deserialize data from 7TV API.

# I want to use it in Unity!
As SevenTV-lib is written in .NET Standard 2.1 you have to change 'Api Compatibility Level' to .NET 4.x.
